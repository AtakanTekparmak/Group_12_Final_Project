## Usage

Make sure you have all the dependencies installed. You can do that manually by making sure you are in the project directory or run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

After this you can run **main.py** in any way you are used to. The command for that is:
```
python main.py

// or

python3 main.py
```

Note: The program may take multiple hours to complete.
